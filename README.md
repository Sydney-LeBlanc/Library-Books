# Library-Books
A program that inserts and removes books from a library, checking if the insertion and removal is successful. The program will indicate the insertion has failed if it tries to insert a book already in the library, and will indicate the removal has failed if it tries to remove a book not in the library. This assignment was to focus on C++ Classes, and Object-Oriented Design.
